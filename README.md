# sketchybar configuration

My sketchybar configuration files. I use sketchybar because when "Displays have separate Spaces" is disabled, macOS shows the menu bar only on the primary display; sketchybar provides a consistent, customizable status bar across displays.

The present config for sketchybar is done entirely in lua (and some C), using [SbarLua](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SbarLua).
One-line install for sketchybar config (requires brew to be installed):
```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/binbinsh/sketchybar-config/main/install_sketchybar.sh | sh
```

## Optional setup

- **LM Studio CLI**
  - Install with `~/.lmstudio/bin/lms bootstrap` (or ensure `lms` is on your PATH). The popup provides an install hint if missing.

- **Raycast (for Clipboard and Dictionary)**
  - Clipboard requires the Raycast Clipboard History extension; there is no fallback.
  - Dictionary requires the ‚ÄúTranslate‚Äù extension (`gebeto/translate`); there is no fallback.

- **iStat Menus**
  - Enable the ‚ÄúCombined‚Äù menu extra so it can be aliased into the bar.

- **Time Machine**
  - Uses `tmutil` (bundled with macOS) to read last backup/snapshot times.

- **Quantumult X**
  - Uses `curl` to query plain-text `ipinfo.io` endpoints for IP/location/ISP.

- **WeChat**
  - Requires the macOS WeChat app to be installed (`com.tencent.xinWeChat`).
  - Recommended: enable App Icon Badges in System Settings ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí WeChat.
  - Recommended: allow ‚Äúosascript‚Äù in System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Accessibility.

- **Synergy icons**
  - Follow the grayscale conversion steps in [Synergy Icon (Grayscale Idle; Colored on Hover)](#synergy-icon-grayscale-idle-colored-on-hover).

- **OpenWeather API Key**
  - Register a free API key from https://openweathermap.org/api (1,000 free calls/day)
  - Store key in Keychain once:
    ```bash
    security add-generic-password -a "$USER" -s OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY -w '<YOUR_API_KEY>' -U
    ```
  - The widget reads it with:
    ```bash
    security find-generic-password -a "$USER" -s OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY -w
    ```
  - Note: After registration, wait 1‚Äì2 hours for the API key to become active.

- **YouTube Music Bridge (Chrome/Brave Extension)**
  - Load the unpacked extension from `helpers/event_providers/now_playing/extension/`:
    - Open `chrome://extensions`, enable Developer mode, click "Load unpacked" ‚Üí select the extension folder.
    - Copy the Extension ID shown on the extension card (see screenshot below).
  - Install the native messaging host:
    ```bash
    helpers/event_providers/now_playing/extension/install_bridge.sh --ext-id <EXTENSION_ID>
    ```
    This writes `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/com.sketchybar.nowplaying.json` pointing to `~/.config/sketchybar/helpers/event_providers/now_playing/bin/now_playing` and whitelists your extension ID.
  - Restart the browser (`chrome://restart` or `brave://restart`), then play/pause on `https://music.youtube.com` to validate.
  - Screenshot showing the Extension ID:

## `now_playing` Event Provider

- What it is: a helper binary at `helpers/event_providers/now_playing/bin/now_playing` that bridges browser media playback (via Native Messaging) and Apple Music control (via AppleScript) to SketchyBar.
- Why: display real-time track metadata from YouTube Music (Chrome/Brave) and control Apple Music playback directly from the bar.
- How it works:
  - **Native Messaging mode**: When invoked by the browser extension, it receives track metadata (title, artist, album, state, elapsed, duration) and triggers the SketchyBar event `media_nowplaying`.
- **Standalone mode**: When run with an argument (`previous|next|toggle|playpause`), it first tries to control YouTube Music tabs in Chrome/Brave (injecting JS to click play/pause/next/prev), then falls back to controlling Apple Music via AppleScript.
- Permissions:
  - No special permissions required for Native Messaging.
  - Apple Music control requires the Music app to be installed and accessible via AppleScript.
- Troubleshooting:
  - If the extension cannot connect, verify the native host manifest is installed correctly (see installation steps above).
  - Check the extension's Service Worker console for connection errors.
  - Ensure the binary is executable: `chmod +x ~/.config/sketchybar/helpers/event_providers/now_playing/bin/now_playing`.

## SketchyBar Location Helper

- What it is: a tiny, bundled app at `helpers/event_providers/location/bin/SketchyBarLocationHelper.app` that gets your current coordinates via Core Location and writes them to a cache file read by the Weather widget.
- Why: avoid external dependencies and get user-approved location with proper macOS prompts.
- How it works:
  - On demand, `items/widgets/weather.lua` runs:
    - `open -W ~/.config/sketchybar/helpers/event_providers/location/bin/SketchyBarLocationHelper.app`
  - The helper requests When-In-Use authorization (first run shows a system prompt) and fetches one-shot location.
  - It writes a cache line to `~/.cache/sketchybar/location.txt` in the format: `ts|lat|lon|label` (the label is filled later by reverse geocoding).
  - The weather widget reads the coordinates, reverse-geocodes a human-friendly place name via OpenStreetMap, caches it, then queries OpenWeather.
- Permissions:
  - First run will show a Location Services prompt for ‚ÄúSketchyBar Location Helper‚Äù. Approve ‚ÄúWhile Using the App‚Äù.
  - You can manage this under System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Location Services.
- Troubleshooting:
  - If it times out (~15s) or shows ‚Äú‚ö†Ô∏èLOC‚Äù on the bar, re-run the weather widget or check Location Services are enabled.
  - Delete caches and retry: `rm -f ~/.cache/sketchybar/location.txt ~/.cache/sketchybar/weather.txt`.

## Space snapshot scan without yabai

- What it is: a tiny C helper at `helpers/event_providers/space_scan/space_scan.c` that scans the currently active Space for on-screen app windows and publishes a `space_snapshot` event consumed by `items/spaces.lua` to render per-space app icons.
- Why: ensure the Space indicator shows correct icons at bar startup and after Space switches, without relying on yabai.
- How it works:
  - Enumerates on-screen windows via CoreGraphics (layer 0 only) and counts them per owning app.
  - Uses private SkyLight entry points to determine the current Space index on the main display.
  - Emits a SketchyBar event:
    - event name: `space_snapshot`
    - payload: `space='<index>' apps='AppA:2|AppB:1|‚Ä¶'`
  - `items/spaces.lua` subscribes to `space_snapshot` and updates the label of the corresponding `space.<index>` item immediately.
- When it runs:
  - Automatically on bar startup and on every `space_change` (wired in `items/spaces.lua`).
  - Can also be invoked manually:

```bash
$CONFIG_DIR/helpers/event_providers/space_scan/bin/space_scan
```

- Build/install: compiled automatically by `helpers/makefile` when SketchyBar starts (see `helpers/init.lua`).
- Limitations:
  - Uses SkyLight (private) APIs; behavior may change across macOS releases.
  - Scans the active Space only; other Spaces are initialized to ‚Äú ‚Äî‚Äù until you switch to them. If you need all Spaces populated at once, extend the helper to map windows to all Spaces before emitting events.

## Synergy Icon (Grayscale Idle; Colored on Hover)

`items/widgets/synergy.lua` expects a grayscale icon at `~/.config/sketchybar/icons/synergy_gray.png`.
Create it once from your color icon using macOS `sips`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/sketchybar/icons
sips --matchTo \
"/System/Library/ColorSync/Profiles/Generic Gray Gamma 2.2 Profile.icc" \
~/.config/sketchybar/icons/synergy.png \
--out ~/.config/sketchybar/icons/synergy_gray.png
```
